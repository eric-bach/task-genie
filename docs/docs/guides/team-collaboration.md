# Team Collaboration

Learn how to effectively collaborate with your team using Task Genie.

## Team Setup

### Organization Structure

Task Genie supports multi-team environments with hierarchical organization:

```
Organization
├── Business Unit A
│   ├── Team Alpha (Project 1)
│   ├── Team Beta (Project 2)
│   └── Team Gamma (Project 3)
└── Business Unit B
    ├── Team Delta (Project 4)
    └── Team Epsilon (Project 5)
```

### Team Configuration

Each team can have their own settings:

- **Custom Prompts**: Team-specific AI behavior
- **Knowledge Base**: Project-specific documentation
- **Workflow Settings**: Sprint length, estimation scale
- **Integration Settings**: Azure DevOps project mapping

## Collaboration Workflows

### Sprint Planning

**1. Pre-Sprint Preparation**

- Product Owner writes user stories with acceptance criteria
- Scrum Master ensures knowledge base is up to date
- Team Lead reviews and adjusts AI prompts based on feedback

**2. Sprint Planning Session**

- Generate initial task breakdown using Task Genie
- Team reviews and refines generated tasks
- Estimate effort using team's preferred scale
- Assign tasks based on expertise and capacity

**3. Post-Planning Review**

- Archive sprint planning session notes
- Update knowledge base with any new decisions
- Gather feedback on task generation quality

### Knowledge Sharing

#### Cross-Team Learning

- Share effective prompts between teams
- Maintain organization-wide best practices
- Regular knowledge base reviews and updates

#### Documentation Standards

Teams should maintain consistent documentation:

```markdown
# Standard Document Template

## Overview

Brief description of the component/feature

## Architecture

Technical implementation details

## API Reference

Endpoints, parameters, responses

## Examples

Code samples and use cases

## Testing

Unit tests, integration tests, scenarios

## Deployment

Build and deployment instructions
```

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

### Product Owner

- **Story Writing**: Create clear, detailed user stories
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define testable requirements
- **Prioritization**: Maintain product backlog priority
- **Feedback**: Provide input on generated task quality

### Scrum Master

- **Configuration**: Manage team settings and prompts
- **Knowledge Base**: Ensure documentation is current
- **Process**: Facilitate effective use of Task Genie
- **Metrics**: Monitor and report on team efficiency gains

### Development Team

- **Task Review**: Validate generated tasks for accuracy
- **Implementation**: Complete tasks as specified
- **Feedback**: Report issues and suggest improvements
- **Documentation**: Update knowledge base with learnings

### Team Lead

- **Technical Guidance**: Ensure tasks align with architecture
- **Code Review**: Verify implementation matches specifications
- **Mentoring**: Help team members use Task Genie effectively
- **Quality**: Maintain coding standards and best practices

## Communication Patterns

### Daily Standups

Incorporate Task Genie metrics into daily discussions:

- "Which generated tasks were completed yesterday?"
- "Are the AI-generated tasks clear and actionable?"
- "Any blockers related to task specifications?"

### Sprint Reviews

Include Task Genie effectiveness in retrospectives:

- **What worked well**: High-quality task generation
- **What didn't work**: Unclear or incomplete tasks
- **Action items**: Prompt adjustments, knowledge base updates

### Cross-Team Collaboration

Share insights across teams:

- **Monthly showcases**: Demonstrate effective configurations
- **Knowledge sessions**: Share best practices and learnings
- **Standardization**: Align on common approaches and templates

## Quality Assurance

### Task Quality Metrics

Track these metrics per team:

```typescript
interface TaskQualityMetrics {
  accuracyRate: number; // % tasks requiring no edits
  completenessScore: number; // Average completeness rating
  clarityRating: number; // Team clarity assessment
  timeToImplement: number; // Average task completion time
}
```

### Feedback Loops

Establish regular feedback mechanisms:

**Weekly**: Quick pulse check on task quality
**Sprint**: Detailed retrospective on AI effectiveness  
**Monthly**: Cross-team sharing and standardization
**Quarterly**: Strategic review and roadmap planning

### Continuous Improvement

- **A/B Testing**: Compare different prompt strategies
- **Baseline Metrics**: Measure improvement over time
- **Best Practice Sharing**: Document and share successes
- **Training Sessions**: Regular team education on effective usage

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Inconsistent Task Quality

**Solution**:

- Standardize user story templates
- Improve knowledge base documentation
- Regular prompt optimization sessions

### Challenge: Team Resistance to AI-Generated Tasks

**Solution**:

- Start with simple, low-risk user stories
- Demonstrate clear value and time savings
- Involve team in prompt customization process

### Challenge: Over-Reliance on Generated Tasks

**Solution**:

- Encourage critical review of all generated tasks
- Maintain human oversight and validation
- Regular training on task breakdown principles

### Challenge: Knowledge Base Maintenance

**Solution**:

- Assign rotating ownership for documentation updates
- Include knowledge base updates in definition of done
- Regular audits and cleanup sessions

## Success Stories

### Team Alpha: 40% Reduction in Planning Time

- **Before**: 4-hour sprint planning sessions
- **After**: 2.5-hour sessions with higher quality outcomes
- **Key**: Invested in comprehensive knowledge base upfront

### Team Beta: Improved Consistency

- **Before**: Inconsistent task granularity across sprints
- **After**: Standardized task breakdown and estimation
- **Key**: Developed team-specific prompts and templates

### Team Gamma: Better Cross-Training

- **Before**: Knowledge siloed with individual developers
- **After**: Shared understanding through documented tasks
- **Key**: Used generated tasks as teaching and learning tools
