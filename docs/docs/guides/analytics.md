# Analytics & Reporting

Monitor Task Genie performance and measure team productivity improvements.

## Overview

Task Genie provides comprehensive analytics to help teams understand their AI-assisted development workflow and optimize their processes.

## Key Metrics

### Task Generation Quality

#### Accuracy Rate

Percentage of generated tasks that require no modifications:

```
Accuracy Rate = (Tasks Used As-Is / Total Tasks Generated) × 100
```

**Target**: >85% accuracy rate
**Benchmark**: Teams typically see 60-90% accuracy

#### Completeness Score

How well generated tasks cover all necessary work:

```typescript
interface CompletenessScore {
  frontend: number; // UI/UX tasks covered
  backend: number; // API/service tasks covered
  testing: number; // Test coverage tasks
  deployment: number; // DevOps tasks covered
  documentation: number; // Docs and specs covered
}
```

#### Clarity Rating

Team-assessed clarity of generated tasks (1-5 scale):

- **5**: Crystal clear, immediately actionable
- **4**: Clear with minor clarification needed
- **3**: Understandable but requires some interpretation
- **2**: Vague, needs significant clarification
- **1**: Unclear, requires complete rewrite

### Productivity Metrics

#### Sprint Planning Efficiency

Time spent in sprint planning sessions:

```
Efficiency Gain = (Baseline Time - Current Time) / Baseline Time × 100
```

**Baseline**: Pre-Task Genie planning time
**Target**: 30-50% reduction in planning time

#### Velocity Impact

Story points completed per sprint:

```typescript
interface VelocityMetrics {
  averageVelocity: number; // Points per sprint
  velocityTrend: number; // % change over time
  taskAccuracy: number; // Estimated vs actual effort
  scopeStability: number; // Mid-sprint changes
}
```

#### Time to First Commit

Time from task assignment to first code commit:

```
Reduced Ambiguity = (Baseline Time to Commit - Current Time) / Baseline Time × 100
```

## ROI Calculation

### Cost Savings Analysis

**Time Savings**

```
Annual Savings = (Hours Saved per Sprint × Sprints per Year × Hourly Rate × Team Size)

Example:
- 2 hours saved per sprint
- 26 sprints per year
- $75 average hourly rate
- 8 team members
= 2 × 26 × $75 × 8 = $31,200 per team per year
```

**Quality Improvements**

```
Defect Reduction Savings = (Reduced Defects × Average Fix Cost)

Example:
- 15% reduction in post-release defects
- Average fix cost: $2,500
- Baseline: 20 defects per quarter
= 3 × $2,500 = $7,500 per quarter
```

**Productivity Gains**

```
Velocity Improvement Value = (Velocity Increase × Story Point Value)

Example:
- 20% velocity increase
- Baseline: 100 story points per sprint
- Story point value: $500
= 20 × $500 = $10,000 per sprint
```

## Success Metrics by Team Size

- **Planning Time**: 30-40% reduction
- **Task Accuracy**: 75-85%
- **Satisfaction**: 4.2+/5.0
