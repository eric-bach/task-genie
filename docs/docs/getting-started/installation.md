## Method 1: Azure DevOps Extension

The [Task Genie Azure DevOps Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AMA.task-genie) provides the quickest and most user-friendly way to get started with Task Genie. It adds a `Generate Tasks` button directly to your User Story work item forms that can be used to trigger **Task Genie**.

### Prerequisites

Before installing the extension, ensure you have:

- **Azure DevOps Project Access**: Write permissions to work items in your project

     ![Custom Control](../../static/img/custom_control.png)
   - Configure the control settings:
     - **Label**: "Task Genie"
     - **API URL**: Reference your configured API endpoint
     - **API Key**: Reference your configured API key
   - Save the changes

   - Click `Options` and set the API URL and API Key to the values in the AWS environment
     ![Custom Control Options](../../static/img/custom_control_options.png)

4. The `Generate Tasks` button should now appear on any User Stories using the Process
   ![](../../static/img/azure_devops_user_story.png)

### Using the Extension

Once installed and configured:

1. **Open a User Story**

   - Navigate to any User Story work item in your project
   - The "Generate Tasks" button will appear in the work item form

2. **Generate Tasks**

   - Click the **Generate Tasks** button
   - Task Genie will analyze your user story
   - Generated tasks will be automatically created and linked to your story

3. **Review Generated Tasks**
   - Check the **Related Work** section for newly created tasks
   - Review and modify tasks as needed
   - Tasks are ready for sprint planning and assignment

### Troubleshooting Extension Issues

**Button Not Appearing?**

- Verify the extension is installed for your project
- Check that the control was added to the User Story layout
- Ensure you have proper permissions to view custom controls

**API Connection Issues?**

- Verify the API URL is correct and accessible
- Check that the API key is valid and has proper permissions
- Review browser developer tools for network errors

## Method 2: Service Hooks Integration

Service Hooks provide automatic, real-time integration with Task Genie. This method is ideal for organizations wanting seamless, automated task generation without manual intervention.

### Prerequisites

- **Azure DevOps Project Administrator Access**: Required to configure Service Hooks
- **Task Genie Deployment**: Completed backend deployment with API Gateway endpoint
- **API Gateway Configuration**: Proper API key setup for authentication

### Important Limitations

:::warning Azure DevOps Service Hooks Limitation
Azure DevOps Service Hooks can only trigger on individual field changes. When Title, Description, and Acceptance Criteria are updated simultaneously, Task Genie will be triggered 3 times, potentially generating 3x the number of tasks. This is a limitation of Azure DevOps, not Task Genie.
:::

### Service Hooks Configuration

#### Step 1: Access Project Settings

1. **Navigate to Project Settings**

   - In your Azure DevOps project, click the gear icon
   - Select **Project Settings** from the dropdown

2. **Open Service Hooks**
   - In the left sidebar, click **Service hooks**
   - This section manages external service integrations

#### Step 2: Create Service Hooks

You need to create **four (4) separate Service Hooks** for comprehensive integration:

:::warning Azure DevOps Limitations

When configuring multiple Service Hooks for different fields on the same action (i.e. Work item updated), the Service Hook will trigger for each field change. For example, if the title and description is updated, **Task Genie** will be triggered twice.

:::

| Hook Type | Trigger Event                           | Purpose                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Hook 1    | Work item created                       | Analyze new User Stories            |
| Hook 2    | Work item updated (Title)               | Re-analyze when title changes       |
| Hook 3    | Work item updated (Description)         | Re-analyze when description changes |
| Hook 4    | Work item updated (Acceptance Criteria) | Re-analyze when criteria change     |

#### Step 3: Configure Each Service Hook

For each of the four hooks, follow these steps:

1. **Create New Service Hook**

   - Click the **+** (plus) button
   - Select **Web Hooks** as the service type

2. **Configure Trigger Settings**

   - **Trigger on this type of event**:
     - For Hook 1: "Work item created"
     - For Hooks 2-4: "Work item updated"
   - **Area path**: Select your project area path
   - **Work item type**: Select "User Story"
   - **Field**: (For update hooks only)
     - Hook 2: "Title"
     - Hook 3: "Description"
     - Hook 4: "Acceptance Criteria"

3. **Configure Action Settings**

   - **URL**: `https://{API_GATEWAY_ID}.execute-api.{REGION}.amazonaws.com/prod/executions`
   - **HTTP Headers**:
     ```
     x-api-key: {YOUR_API_KEY}
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```
   - **Resource details to send**: Select "All"
   - **Messages to send**: Select "All"

4. **Test the Configuration**
   - Click **Test** to verify the connection
   - Ensure you receive a successful response
   - Save the Service Hook

#### Step 4: Verify Integration

1. **Create a Test User Story**

   - Create a new User Story with title, description, and acceptance criteria
   - Task Genie should automatically analyze and generate tasks

2. **Monitor Service Hook Activity**
   - Return to **Service hooks** in project settings
   - Click on each hook to view activity logs
   - Verify successful executions and troubleshoot any failures

### Service Hooks Best Practices

**Minimize Duplicate Triggers**

- Update User Story fields one at a time when possible
- Use bulk edit operations sparingly
- Consider disabling hooks temporarily during large migrations

**Monitor API Usage**

- Track Service Hook execution logs regularly
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for API Gateway errors
- Monitor AWS costs related to increased API calls

### Troubleshooting Service Hooks

**Hooks Not Triggering?**

- Verify the Service Hook is enabled and properly configured
- Check that the work item type and field filters are correct
- Review Azure DevOps activity logs for hook execution

**API Errors?**

- Validate the API Gateway endpoint URL
- Ensure the API key is correctly formatted in headers
- Check AWS CloudWatch logs for backend errors

**Duplicate Task Generation?**

- Review which hooks are triggering simultaneously
- Consider implementing deduplication logic in your backend
- Monitor task creation patterns and adjust accordingly
