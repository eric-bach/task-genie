# Prompt Overrides

**Task Genie** comes default with a standard built-in `software development` prompt. **Prompt Overrides** allows customization on how the AI generates tasks by replacing the default prompt with specific instructions. This powerful feature enables teams to fine-tune the default prompt and/or tailor task generation to team specific development practices, coding standards, and domain-specific requirements.

## How Prompt Overrides Work

### Prompt Resolution Process

When Task Genie generates tasks, it follows this resolution hierarchy:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Generation Request] --> B{Parameter Prompt Provided?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Use Parameter Prompt]
    B -->|No|  D{Database Config Exists?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Use Stored Team Prompt]
    D -->|No|  F[Use Default System Prompt]

    C --> G[Generate Tasks with Custom Instructions]
    E --> G
    F --> H[Generate Tasks with Standard Instructions]
```

## Configuration

### Configuration Structure

Each prompt override configuration contains:

```javascript
{
  "adoKey": "MyProject\\Team Alpha#Engineering#Customer Portal",
  "areaPath": "MyProject\\Team Alpha",
  "businessUnit": "Engineering",
  "system": "Customer Portal",
  "prompt": "Your custom task generation instructions...",
  "createdAt": "2025-09-23T10:30:00Z",
  "createdBy": "developer@company.com",
  "updatedAt": "2025-09-23T15:45:00Z",
  "updatedBy": "teamlead@company.com"
}
```

### Lookup Mechanism

Task Genie automatically retrieves the appropriate prompt using a composite key made up of the **Area Path**, **Business Unit**, and **System**:

```
adoKey = "{areaPath}#{businessUnit}#{system}"
```

**Example Lookup:**

- Work Item Area Path: `"MyProject\Team Alpha"`
- Work Item Business Unit: `"Engineering"`
- Work Item System: `"Customer Portal"`
- Generated Key: `"MyProject\\Team Alpha#Engineering#Customer Portal"`

### Configuration Management

#### **Creating New Prompt Overrides**

1. **Access Configuration Interface**

   - Navigate to Task Genie web interface
   - Go to **Configuration** â†’ **Prompt Overrides**
   - Click **New Override** button

2. **Set Targeting Parameters**

   ```
   Area Path: Select from your Azure DevOps area paths
   Business Unit: Choose organizational unit (e.g., "Engineering")
   System: Specify target application (e.g., "Customer Portal")
   ```

3. **Write Custom Prompt**

   - Enter your team-specific task generation instructions
   - Focus on development methodology, coding standards, testing requirements
   - Include domain-specific context and business rules

4. **Save and Activate**
   - Configuration is immediately active for matching work items
   - All future task generation will use the custom prompt
   - Historical tasks are not affected

#### **Editing Existing Configurations**

1. **Locate Configuration**

   - Browse existing prompt overrides in the web interface
   - Use filters to find specific team configurations

2. **Edit Prompt Only**

   - Area Path, Business Unit, and System are immutable after creation
   - Only the custom prompt text can be modified
   - This prevents accidental targeting changes

3. **Version Control**
   - Each edit updates the `updatedAt` timestamp and `updatedBy` field
   - Consider maintaining prompt documentation in your team's repository

#### **Deleting Configurations**

1. **Confirmation Required**

   - Type "confirm" to proceed with deletion
   - Action cannot be undone
   - Affected work items will fall back to default prompt

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Review which work items will be affected
   - Consider the number of stories in your backlog matching the configuration
   - Coordinate with team members before deletion

## System Integration

### Automatic Context Enhancement

All custom prompts are automatically enhanced with contextual information:

#### **Work Item Context Injection**

```text
Your custom prompt...

**Context**
- Here is the work item:
  - Title: {User Story Title}
  - Description: {Detailed Description}
  - Acceptance Criteria: {Given/When/Then scenarios}

- Here are the tasks that have already been created for this work item (if any):
  {Existing Task List or "None"}

- Here are the images referenced (if any were included):
  {Image URLs and descriptions}

- Here is additional context that you should consider (if any were provided):
  {Knowledge Base Content}

**Output Rules**
- ONLY return a JSON object with the following structure:
  - "tasks": array of task objects, each with:
    - "title": string (task title, prefixed with order, e.g., "1. Task Title")
    - "description": string (detailed task description with HTML formatting)
- DO NOT output any text outside of the JSON object.
```

#### **Knowledge Base Integration**

Custom prompts work seamlessly with the Knowledge Base system:

- **Project-Scoped Knowledge**: Automatically retrieves team-specific technical documentation
- **Contextual Enhancement**: Adds relevant architecture, API specs, and business rules
- **Prompt Augmentation**: Knowledge base content enhances custom prompt instructions

Example of enhanced prompt with knowledge base content:

```text
Your custom prompt: "Generate React component tasks following our design system..."

Enhanced with knowledge base:
- Design System Documentation: "Use styled-components with theme tokens..."
- API Standards: "All API calls should use our custom useApi hook..."
- Testing Guidelines: "React components require Jest + React Testing Library tests..."
```

### Performance Considerations

#### **Prompt Length Optimization**

1. **Token Efficiency**

   - Keep prompts concise while maintaining specificity
   - Use bullet points and structured formatting
   - Avoid redundant or overly verbose instructions

2. **Context Window Management**

   - Balance custom prompt length with context injection needs
   - Consider that knowledge base content also consumes tokens
   - Monitor total prompt length to stay within model limits

3. **Response Quality vs. Speed**
   - Longer, more detailed prompts may produce higher quality tasks
   - Shorter prompts result in faster generation times
   - Find the optimal balance for your team's needs

#### **Caching and Performance**

1. **Database Configuration Caching**

   - Prompt configurations are cached for performance
   - Changes take effect immediately for new requests
   - No need to restart services after prompt updates

2. **Parameter Override Processing**
   - Parameter-based prompts bypass database lookup
   - Slightly faster processing for one-off customizations
   - Useful for high-frequency API usage scenarios

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### **Prompt Override Not Applied**

**Symptoms:**

- Tasks generated using default prompt despite custom configuration
- No indication of custom prompt usage in logs

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. Verify work item metadata matches configuration targeting

   ```
   Work Item Area Path: "MyProject\Team Alpha"
   Config Area Path: "MyProject\\Team Alpha"  // Note: exact match required
   ```

2. Check configuration status in web interface

   - Ensure configuration exists and is not deleted
   - Verify prompt content is not empty

3. Review system logs for prompt resolution
   - Look for "Using prompt override" log messages
   - Check for database connectivity issues

**Solutions:**

- Update work item fields to match configuration exactly
- Recreate configuration with correct targeting parameters
- Verify database permissions and connectivity

#### **Poor Task Quality with Custom Prompts**

**Symptoms:**

- Generated tasks are unclear, incomplete, or inappropriate
- Tasks don't follow team standards despite custom instructions

1. Review prompt content for clarity and specificity
2. Test prompt with various user story types
3. Compare results with default prompt output

**Solutions:**

- Add more specific instructions and examples
- Include context about team practices and standards
- Break complex prompts into structured sections
- Iterate based on developer feedback

#### **Parameter Override Not Working**

**Symptoms:**

- Custom prompt provided in API request is ignored
- Database configuration used instead of parameter

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. Verify API request format and parameter structure
2. Check for parameter validation errors
3. Review request logs for prompt resolution messages

**Solutions:**

- Ensure prompt parameter is included in correct request section
- Validate JSON structure and parameter formatting
- Check for authentication and permission issues
