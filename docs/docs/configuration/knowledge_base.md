# Knowledge Base

**Task Genie** leverages Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases with S3 Vectors to provide organizational and project context for highly accurate task breakdown. The system supports two distinct knowledge base types, each serving different purposes in the Agile workflow: **Agile Guided (User Story Evaluation)** and **Project Scoped (Task Generation)**.

## Knowledge Base Types

**Task Genie** uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine AI capabilities with your organization's specific knowledge, ensuring generated tasks and evaluations are contextually relevant and aligned with your team's practices.

| Knowledge Base Type                      | Purpose                                                    | Scope                 | When Applied                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Agile Guided (User Story Evaluation)** | Improve user story quality assessment                      | Organization-wide     | During user story evaluation |
| **Project Scoped (Task Generation)**     | Enhance task breakdown with technical and business context | Team/Project specific | During task generation       |

## Agile Guided Knowledge Base (User Story Evaluation)

The Agile Guided Knowledge Base provides organization-wide guidance for evaluating user story quality, ensuring consistency in Agile practices across all teams and projects.

### Purpose and Benefits

#### **User Story Quality Assessment**

- **Best Practices**: Agile methodology guidelines and standards
- **Template Examples**: Well-written user story templates and patterns
- **Common Patterns**: Effective acceptance criteria formats
- **Quality Criteria**: Evaluation rubrics and checklists

#### **Organization-Wide Consistency**

Agile Guided documents apply to all user stories regardless of team, project, or system, ensuring consistent quality standards across the organization.

### How Agile Guided Knowledge Works

#### **Evaluation Query Construction**

**Task Genie** searches the Agile Guided Knowledge Base for any process guidance on evaluating a user story:

```
Find relevant information about the user story process and guidelines that would help evaluate the following user story is well-defined:
- Title: [User Story Title]
- Description: [User Story Description]
- Acceptance Criteria: [Acceptance Criteria]
```

:::warning Retrieval Chunks

**Task Genie** will retrieve up to 3 chunks from the knowledge base

:::

#### **Integration with Story Evaluation**

Retrieved guidance is then added as context to enhances the User Story evaluation process:

```
Additional business or domain context from knowledge base:
- User Story Best Practices: Stories should follow the "As a... I want... So that..." format
- Acceptance Criteria Standards: Use Given/When/Then format for testable scenarios
- Definition of Ready: All stories must include persona, rationale, and clear criteria
```

### Document Organization for Agile Guided Knowledge

#### **Required Metadata**

All Agile Guided documents must use this specific metadata (automatically added by **Task Genie**):

```javascript
{
  "areaPath": "agile-process",
}
```

#### **Content Categories**

Organize Agile Guided content into these categories:

```
Agile Process Knowledge/
├── user-story-standards/
│   ├── story-template-guidelines.md
│   ├── acceptance-criteria-formats.md
│   └── persona-definitions.md
├── quality-criteria/
│   ├── definition-of-ready.md
│   ├── story-evaluation-rubric.md
│   └── common-anti-patterns.md
├── process-guidelines/
│   ├── sprint-planning-best-practices.md
│   ├── backlog-refinement-process.md
│   └── estimation-techniques.md
└── templates-examples/
    ├── epic-breakdown-examples.md
    ├── well-written-story-samples.md
    └── acceptance-criteria-templates.md
```

### Best Practices for Agile Guided Knowledge

**Common Story Problems:**

```markdown
# User Story Anti-Patterns to Avoid

## The "As a Developer" Anti-Pattern

❌ **Wrong:** "As a developer, I want to refactor the authentication module so that code is cleaner"
✅ **Right:** "As a customer, I want faster login response times so that I can access my account quickly"

## The Technical Task Disguised as Story

❌ **Wrong:** "As a user, I want the database to be optimized so that queries run faster"  
✅ **Right:** "As a customer, I want search results to load in under 2 seconds so that I can find products efficiently"

## The Epic Masquerading as Story

❌ **Wrong:** "As a customer, I want a complete e-commerce platform so that I can shop online"
✅ **Right:** "As a customer, I want to add items to my shopping cart so that I can purchase multiple products at once"

## Vague Acceptance Criteria

❌ **Wrong:** "The system should work properly and be user-friendly"
✅ **Right:** "Login succeeds within 3 seconds with valid credentials and displays helpful error messages for invalid attempts"
```

## Project Scoped Knowledge Base (Task Generation)

The Project Scoped Knowledge Base provides team-specific context to improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated tasks. Documents in this knowledge base are filtered and applied based on the Azure DevOps Boards fields: **Area Path**, **Business Unit**, and **System**.

### Purpose and Benefits

#### **Enhanced Task Generation**

- **Technical Context**: Architecture diagrams, API specifications, coding standards
- **Business Context**: Domain knowledge, business rules, workflow patterns
- **Team Practices**: Development methodologies, testing strategies, deployment procedures
- **System Knowledge**: Component relationships, dependencies, integration patterns

#### **Targeted Application**

Documents are automatically retrieved based on matching criteria:

- **Area Path**: Azure DevOps area path hierarchy
- **Business Unit**: Organizational division (e.g., "Engineering", "Product")
- **System**: Application or service identifier (e.g., "Customer Portal", "Payment Service")

### How Project Scoped Knowledge Works

#### **Required Metadata**

Documents are automatically retrieved based on matching criteria:

- **Area Path**: Azure DevOps area path hierarchy
- **Business Unit**: AMA custom field denoting the business unit name
- **System**: AMA custom field denoting the application name

When generating tasks, Task Genie builds search filters based on the user story's metadata:

```javascript
// Example filtering logic
{
  "filter": {
    "andAll": [
      { "equals": { "key": "areaPath", "value": "MyProject\\Team Alpha" } },
      { "equals": { "key": "businessUnit", "value": "Engineering" } },
      { "equals": { "key": "system", "value": "Customer Portal" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### **Knowledge Retrieval Query**

**Task Genie** constructs context-aware queries to find relevant documentation:

```
Find relevant information to help with task breakdown (such as technical details,
application architecture, business context, etc.) for the following user story:
- Title: [User Story Title]
- Description: [User Story Description]
- Acceptance Criteria: [Acceptance Criteria]
```

:::warning Retrieval Chunks

**Task Genie** will retrieve up to 3 chunks from the knowledge base

:::

#### **Integration with Task Generation**

Retrieved knowledge is seamlessly integrated into the AI prompt:

```
Here is additional context that you should consider:
- Architecture: The Customer Portal uses React frontend with Node.js backend...
- Business Rules: Payment processing must comply with PCI DSS standards...
- Testing Strategy: All API endpoints require unit tests and integration tests...
```

### Document Organization Structure

#### **Recommended Folder Hierarchy**

Organize your Project Scoped documents using this structure:

```
Knowledge Base/
├── [Business Unit]/
│   ├── [System]/
│   │   ├── technical-docs/
│   │   │   ├── api-specifications.md
│   │   │   ├── architecture-diagrams.pdf
│   │   │   └── database-schema.md
│   │   ├── business-rules/
│   │   │   ├── domain-logic.md
│   │   │   ├── workflow-patterns.md
│   │   │   └── compliance-requirements.md
│   │   └── team-practices/
│   │       ├── coding-standards.md
│   │       ├── testing-guidelines.md
│   │       └── deployment-procedures.md
```

### Content Guidelines for Project Scoped Documents

#### **Technical Documentation**

**API Specifications:**

```markdown
# Customer API Endpoints

## Authentication

All endpoints require JWT token authentication...

## User Management Endpoints

- POST /api/users - Create new user
- GET /api/users/{id} - Retrieve user details
- PUT /api/users/{id} - Update user information

## Common Response Patterns

All API responses follow this structure:
{
"data": {},
"errors": [],
"meta": {}
}
```

**Architecture Patterns:**

```markdown
# Microservices Architecture

## Service Communication

- Synchronous: REST APIs for real-time operations
- Asynchronous: Event-driven messaging via AWS SQS
- Data Storage: Each service owns its database

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- Authentication: Centralized via Auth Service
- Logging: Structured logging with CloudWatch
- Monitoring: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
```

#### **Business Context Documentation**

**Domain Rules:**

```markdown
# Payment Processing Rules

## Validation Requirements

- Credit card numbers must pass Luhn algorithm validation
- Transaction amounts cannot exceed $10,000 without approval
- International transactions require additional verification

## Compliance Standards

- PCI DSS Level 1 compliance required for card data
- GDPR compliance for EU customer data
- SOX compliance for financial reporting
```

**Workflow Patterns:**

```markdown
# User Registration Workflow

## Standard Flow

1. User submits registration form
2. System validates email format and password strength
3. Verification email sent to user
4. User clicks verification link
5. Account activated and welcome email sent

## Exception Handling

- Invalid email: Show inline error, keep form data
- Duplicate email: Offer password reset option
- Email delivery failure: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
```

#### **Team Practices Documentation**

**Development Standards:**

```markdown
# Code Review Guidelines

## Required Checks
