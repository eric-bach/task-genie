# Introduction

Welcome to **Task Genie** - an AI-powered assistant that combines the power of AI with Azure DevOps integration to solve common challenges in sprint planning and story management.

## What is Task Genie?

**Task Genie** integrates with **Azure DevOps Boards** and uses the most advanced foundation models to ensure user stories are well-defined and automatically breaks them down into actionable tasks, streamlining the Agile process and enhancing developer productivity.

By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and providing prompt customization, **Task Genie** can be tailored to any Agile use case. See the **Configuration** section for more details.

## Key Problems Task Genie Solves

### üéØ **Incomplete User Stories**

Many user stories lack essential components like clear acceptance criteria, proper context, or technical details. **Task Genie** validates your stories against Agile best practices and identifies missing elements.

### üìã **Manual Task Breakdown**

Breaking down user stories into actionable tasks is time-consuming and often inconsistent. **Task Genie** automates this process while maintaining alignment with Agile methodologies.

### üîÑ **Context Loss**

Teams often lose important domain knowledge and technical context when creating tasks. Task Genie uses RAG to incorporate relevant organizational knowledge, technical documentation, and domain-specific information.

### üìä **Workflow Inefficiencies**

Without proper insights into story quality and task generation patterns, teams struggle to improve their processes. Task Genie provides analytics to optimize your workflow.

## How Task Genie Works

**Task Genie** operates through a serverless architecture on AWS, orchestrated by Step Functions, and with Amazon Bedrock for reliable and scalable AI processing:

### üîç **User Story Evalutation Agent**

1. **Automated Analysis**: When a user story is created or updated in Azure DevOps, Task Genie automatically analyzes its completeness
2. **Best Practice Validation**: Checks for essential components like user personas, acceptance criteria, and clear descriptions
3. **Contextual Enhancement**: Uses organizational knowledge base to identify missing technical or domain-specific details
4. **Improvement Suggestions**: Provides actionable recommendations to enhance story quality

### ü§ñ **Task Generation Agent**

1. **Intelligent Decomposition**: Breaks down validated user stories into smaller, actionable development tasks
2. **Context-Aware**: Incorporates technical requirements, architectural patterns, and team conventions
3. **Agile-Compliant**: Ensures tasks follow Agile principles and can be completed within sprint timeframes
4. **Automatic Integration**: Creates tasks directly in Azure DevOps with proper linking and categorization

## Architecture Overview

Task Genie is built on a modern, serverless architecture that ensures scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness:

### **Cloud Infrastructure**

![Architecture](../static/img/architecture_v2.png)

- **AWS Serverless**: Built entirely on AWS Lambda, Step Functions, S3, DynamoDB, and managed services
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically handles varying workloads without manual intervention
- **Cost-Optimized**: Pay-per-use model with estimated monthly costs around $6 (infrastructure) plus Bedrock foundation model costs (typically $20)

### **Integration Layer**

- **Azure DevOps Service Hooks**: Real-time integration with your existing Azure DevOps boards
- **REST API**: Secure API endpoints for custom integrations and frontend access
- **Extension Support**: Native Azure DevOps extension for seamless user experience

### **AI & Knowledge Management**

- **Amazon Bedrock**: Leverages the most advanced foundation model (Claude 4.5 Sonnet)
- **RAG Implementation**: Combines AI with your organizational knowledge base
- **Vector Search**: Efficient retrieval of relevant context and documentation
- **Prompt Overrides**: Allows customization of the use case for the Task Generation agent

## Getting Started

**Task Genie** can be integrated with your Azure DevOps environment in several ways:

### **Option 1: Azure DevOps Extension**
