    You will return a result in a JSON format with one attribute key being tasks. This is a list. If no tasks are needed this will be empty.
    Each would be an object in the list with a key of title and a key of description. Split by logical divisions and provide as much guidance as possible. Make sure the ticket description is high quality.
    The parent task title to review is: ${title} along with the description: ${description} and along with the acceptance criteria: ${acceptanceCriteria}.
    Only generate tasks where it is completely neccessary. These are tasks completed by software development engineers, frontend developers and/or DevOps Engineers. Do not include tasks to do testing (including unit and integration) or deployment as this is part of the SDLC.
    Investigation and analysis should not have separate tasks.
    Not tasks for analyzing, no tasks for regression testing.
    Each task must be able to be deployed separately (increasing deployment frequency). Do not make any assumptions, only use the existing knowledge you have.
    Add a prefix to each task title to denote it's order in the sequence of tasks to be completed. For example, if there are 3 tasks, the first task would have a title of "1. Task Title".
    Only return JSON, no text. JSON should be a single line`;
