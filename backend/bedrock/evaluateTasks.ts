    description:
      'Currently, Dev environments mock out GP events by sending events directly to their membership event bus. Since we want to remove that event bus, we\'ll need to finally clean that up. GP is probably just writing events to the staging m2 event bus. Get them to additionally write events to the account bus (if they are not already).\nWhy the staging account event bus? GP doesn\'t know about our internal dev env structure, so we need to work around that. \n\nOnce events are written to the staging account event bus, we\'ll need to update our dev lambdas to look for events on the shared bus.  At this point, all dev environments will be getting triggered by the same event. So to avoid any logging issues, we should gracefully stop our dev environments when they see GP events for customer ids outside their database. \n\nLambdas (checklist dev can you confirm):\nPost Payment State machine\nCancel Lambda\nRenewal Lambda\nNote:  We don\'t want the regular flow to be triggered by mocks anymore after this change. However, for a while we\'ll need to mock out the new events for the rebuild flow. The solution for that shouldn\'t interfer with our BFM goal of removing the membership and foundation event bus. Maybe we send the mocked event to the post payment state machine directly?\n\nUpdate\nStephen talked to GP, and they are aleady sending CEB style events to the CEB. Below is a sample. \n\n‚ÄãUse this to query for the latest invoicePaid events via CEB:\nhttps://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/$252Faws$252Fevents$252Faccount-eventbus-all-events-staging/log-events$3FfilterPattern$3DinvoicePaid$26start$3D-3600000\n\n{ "Detail": { "metadata": { "businessAction": "invoicePaid", "correlationId": "30122558-eb34-4101-82b8-d4c831418bdc", "dataContentType": "application/json", "domain": "payment", "id": "52e5eea3-bf43-456c-b4d1-4138fe88374f", "sensitiveData": [ "giftCardPin", "extendedAccountNumber", "iin", "emv_auth_data" ], "source": "gp", "subject": "invoicePaid", "time": "2025-02-25T03:05:59.777Z", "version": "v1" }, "payload": { "correlationInfo": { "customerId": "Lela-Schultz-1wgr2WRqPLceerJcqJD59N" }, "eventData": { "attemptCount": 1, "card": { "brand": "visa", "expMonth": 11, "expYear": 2027, "holderName": "Lela Schultz", "last4": 4242 }, "customerId": "Lela-Schultz-1wgr2WRqPLceerJcqJD59N", "detailType": "invoicePaid", "ESBTransactionGUID": "30122558-eb34-4101-82b8-d4c831418bdc", "idempotencyKey": "714e5e84-eb59-4e5e-bf0d-fe0dec875ab9", "invoiceItems": [ { "amount": 600, "priceCode": "price_CommunityMonthlyFee", "priceName": "Monthly Fee", "productCode": "product_CommunitySubscription", "productName": "AMA Community Membership", "tax": 30 } ], "invoiceNumber": "94000290-0001", "nextPaymentDate": "2025-03-25T03:09:24.000Z", "periodEnd": "2025-03-25T03:09:24.000Z", "periodStart": "2025-02-25T03:09:24.000Z", "receiptNumber": null, "sourceInfo": "", "status": "paid", "subtotal": 600, "tax": 30, "total": 630, "transactionTimestamp": "2025-02-25T03:09:24.000Z" } } }, "DetailType": "invoicePaid", "EventBusName": "mark-eventbus-eventBridgeCeb-v2", "Source": "mark-gp" }',
