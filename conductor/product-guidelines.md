# Product Guidelines for Task Genie

These guidelines define the style, voice, and design principles for Task Genie to ensure a consistent and high-quality user experience across all touchpoints.

## 1. Prose and Communication Style

All written content, including documentation, in-app messages, and release notes, should be:

*   **Clear and Concise:** Prioritize brevity, directness, and simple language to make information easily digestible for all users. Avoid jargon where possible, and explain technical concepts clearly when necessary.

## 2. Brand Messaging and Tone

Task Genie's brand should be communicated with a tone that is:

*   **Supportive and Empowering:** The messaging should focus on assisting users, enhancing their productivity, and making their workflows more efficient. The tone should be helpful and encouraging.
*   **Innovative and Forward-Thinking:** The language should reflect the cutting-edge nature of Task Genie, highlighting its AI capabilities and its role in modernizing development processes.

## 3. Visual Identity

The design of the UI, dashboards, and all visual materials should be guided by a "Modern and Sleek" aesthetic. This includes:

*   Utilizing a contemporary design language.
*   Employing modern fonts and ample spacing for readability.
*   Maintaining a polished and professional look and feel.

## 4. Interaction Design Principles

The user experience should be guided by the following principles:

*   **Seamless Integration:** As a tool that works within Azure DevOps, all interactions should feel natural and extend the existing user experience. The goal is to minimize friction and make Task Genie feel like a native part of the Azure DevOps environment.
*   **Predictable Functionality:** The system must behave in a consistent and expected manner across all features. This reduces cognitive load on the user and builds trust by ensuring that actions have predictable outcomes.
*   **Efficiency and Automation:** The design should enable users to accomplish tasks quickly, with automation taking precedence where possible to streamline workflows.
*   **Feedback and Explainability:** The system must provide clear feedback on its status, progress, and the actions it has taken. To build trust in its AI capabilities, Task Genie should also provide a degree of explainability into how it generated its results.
